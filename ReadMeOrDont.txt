ALL FILES HERE HAVE BEEN HEAVILY EDITED.
SOME SO MUCH SO MOST DONT RESEMBLE THEIR ORIGINAL FILE.

ALL MOST ALL DO STUF THAT THE ORIGINALS DO NOT.
OR IT DOES THEM IN A DIFFERENT MANNOR.

ORIGINAL FILES ARE THAT OF THEIR OWNERS AND CREATORS.
MY EDITS ARE MY OWN, USUALY FOUND IN CAPS, AND MAY INTERFERE WITH OTHER SCRIPTS OR ADDONS.

THIS STUF WAS DONE WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS, BUT THE STAND OUTS ARE:
  SHOUBERT
    CRITO
      FRESH
        DUMDUM
  
  
  @EXILE DISCORD COMMUNITY
    @INFISTAR DISCORD COMMUNITY
    
    
FEEL FREE TO RIP OPEN AND EDIT TO YOUR LIKING.
MOST STUFF HAS ITS INSTALATION STEPS IN THE FILE FOLDER STRUCTURE ITSELF

IF ITS IN ADDONS, IT PROBABLY GETS THROWN INTO YOUR ADDONS FOLDER. ECT...
MOST FILES NEED A LINE TO GO WITH INSIDE ONE OF THEASE FILES

  INIT.SQF
  PLAYERINIT.SQF
  SERVERINIT.SQF
  DESCRIPTION.SQF
  MISSION.SQM
   
EXAMPLE
>>>> I WANNA INSTAL THE [FIRSTPERSON.SQF] SCRIPTY THINGY I SEENED

 DRAG THE FILE [FIRSTPERSON.SQF] INTO THE SAME DIRECTORY OF YOUR SERVER
  INSIDE THAT FILE SHOULD BE THE LINE YOULL NEED TO GO WITH IT.
    ADD THAT LINE TO WHERE IT TELLS YOU TO.
      CHUG BEER AND TURN THE SERVER ON.
      
IF YOU HAD TO CHANGE THE DIRECTORY OF WHERE YOU PUT THE FILE
  OR HAD TO MERGE IT WITH ANOTHER
    OR REASON #3 I CANT THINK OF THAT MADE YOU PUT IT ELSWHERE
    
CHANGE THE DIRECTORY ON THE LINE TO ADD TO THE SERVER TO MATCH ITS NEW HOME.
